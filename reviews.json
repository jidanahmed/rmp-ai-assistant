            "review": "Prof. Williams is a brilliant physicist with a deep understanding of his subject, but his lectures can be challenging to follow.

            "professor": "Dr. Amanda Foster",
            "review": "Dr. Foster is a psychology professor who, unfortunately, falls short in several areas. Her lectures are often disorganized, with her frequently jumping from one topic to another without clear transitions or connections between the material. This lack of structure can make it difficult for students to follow along and understand the key concepts being taught. Additionally, Dr. Foster has a habit of canceling classes, which further disrupts the flow of the course and leaves students feeling unprepared for exams. Despite these issues, the course material itself is interesting, and the textbook used in the class is well-written and informative. Students who are self-motivated and willing to rely heavily on the textbook may still find value in her courses. However, those who prefer more structured and consistent instruction may find her teaching style frustrating.",
